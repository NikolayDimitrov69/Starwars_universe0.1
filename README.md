# Starwars_universe0.1
Star wars universe 0.1 is another university project, implementing command line interface via a variation of Command design pattern. The game is file-based, where the player can add new planets, jedi's and get information about already existing planets such as strongest jedi, how many jedis populate a world and what is the most common light saber color on a planet and others.
